Pathway to a planetary culture of peace and harmonious mutual co-operation:

International law not backed by the sovereignty of free nations is tyranny.

No nation is free where people are not sovereign under God subject to none.

The burden of the strong is to defend the innocent and to uphold the peace.

The duty of the free is to live with honour, upholding justice and freedom.
